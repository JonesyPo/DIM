A lively little quantum 7
went darting through the air, 6
Just as happy quanta 6
go speeding everywhere. 6
He traveled far – this quantum 7
-- urged as if by a call, 6
When he saw a lonely atom 8
with no signs of pep at all, 7

And he started for that atom 9
 in the highest of elation, 8
Said he: “Here’s where I show 6
the trick of transmutation. 7
I’m going to hit that atom 6
 such an awful, awful whack, 8
That I’ll knock out its electrons 8
so far they can’t get back.” 6
So he gave that peaceful atom 8
such an energetic shove, 7
That its outermost electrons 8
soared to levels far above. 7

//Line4
<speak> <prosody volume="loud">
Then the atom got excited, 
and held the quantum fast,
Until the last electron 
came tumbling back at last.
Then the quantum was released, 
and fled in degradation,
While the atom got the credit
 for a lot of radiation.

As I was saying, at this level, your laws don’t seem to work that well. 
This requires a different branch of physics to explain. Bohr  and some others like <prosody rate="medium">Schrödinger</prosody> and <prosody rate="medium">Heisenberg </prosody> discovered a set of laws, dubbed quantum mechanics, which applies to how particles behave at the subatomic level. Atoms can change <prosody volume="loud">into</prosody> other atoms, <s>and the behavior of particles is probabilistic</s>
